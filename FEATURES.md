## Movement and Model
- ✅ Movement: wasd controls for horizontal movement. mouse controls vertical and horizontal rotation of the model.
- ✅ Opted for a solid camera background color instead of a skybox
- ✅ 3D model: Opted to procedurally generate the model and program the movement animation

## World Interaction and Consumables
- ✅ I want to give the player a binary class herbivore/carnivore
- ✅ I want to create a statistic on the player called hunger which depletes with time
- ✅ I want to create a UI element tracking the player's hunger stat
- ✅ I want to create a food consumable object that the player can interact with, and which affects their hunger stat
- ✅ I want to create two types of the food object class for herbivores (green) and carnivores (red)
- ✅ I want to procedurally generate these objects within my bounding box

## AI - Basic: Procedural generation, Pathfindinging
- ✅ Create a single instance of the same character model that you use for the player
- ✅ Create basic AI pathfinding - make the model move continuosly in a random direction. Make the model randomly change direction when it hits the boundry box.
- ✅ Create a prefab for the character
- ✅ Procedurally generate the AI controlled character within your bounding box
