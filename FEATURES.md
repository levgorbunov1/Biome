## Movement and Model
- ✅ Movement: wasd controls for horizontal movement. mouse controls vertical and horizontal rotation of the model.
- ✅ Opted for a solid camera background color instead of a skybox
- ✅ 3D model: Opted to procedurally generate the model and program the movement animation

## World Interaction and Consumables
- ✅ I want to give the player a binary class herbivore/carnivore
- ✅ I want to create a statistic on the player called hunger which depletes with time
- ✅ I want to create a UI element tracking the player's hunger stat
- ✅ I want to create a food consumable object that the player can interact with, and which affects their hunger stat
- ✅ I want to create two types of the food object class for herbivores (green) and carnivores (red)
- ✅ I want to procedurally generate these objects within my bounding box

## Procedural terrain/inanimate prop generation - Current
- Investigate how Minecraft procedurally generates terrain - can we procedurally generate a terrain map from which we procedurally generate a 3D terrain (underwater/overground)
- Investigate Spore style terrain generation - break terrain down into components e.g. hills, trees, water etc. and randomize their creation in a map of a manageable size e.g.
the Spore planet or a defined bounding box.
- Implement the procedural generation of terrain using the chosen method.
