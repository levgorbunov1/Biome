## MVP - Movement and Model
- âœ… I want to start off implementing movement for a basic 3d object like a sphere. I want movement on the x plane to be controlled by wasd. I want movement on the y plane contolled by moving the mouse up/down. I want movement on the z plane to be controlled by moving the mouse left/right. 
- I want the skybox/background to have a theme like I am underwater.
- I want a custom 3D model, using Blender, with custom movement animation.
