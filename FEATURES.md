## Movement and Model
- ✅ Movement: wasd controls for horizontal movement. mouse controls vertical and horizontal rotation of the model.
- ✅ Opted for a solid camera background color instead of a skybox
- ✅ 3D model: Opted to procedurally generate the model and program the movement animation

## World Interaction and Consumables
- ✅ I want to give the player a binary class herbivore/carnivore
- ✅ I want to create a statistic on the player called hunger which depletes with time
- ✅ I want to create a UI element tracking the player's hunger stat
- ✅ I want to create a food consumable object that the player can interact with, and which affects their hunger stat
- ✅ I want to create two types of the food object class for herbivores (green) and carnivores (red)
- ✅ I want to procedurally generate these objects within my bounding box

## Procedural terrain/inanimate prop generation - Current
- I want to procedurally generate terrain in my bounding box from a random seed.
- The terrain will be made up of the following components:
    - Hills (restrict size)
    - Water features 
    - Trees/flora
    - Terrain tecture - desert, grassland etc.
