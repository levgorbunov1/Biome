I'm developing a video game for PC (Steam).

# Setup
- Install Unity Hub and Unity Editor from https://unity.com/download
- Unity should automatically generate certain local files/folders, including:
    - Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj
    - Assembly-CSharp.csproj
    - Library/
    - UserSettings/

# Ideas
- Open to collaboration
- Leverage premade assets - Modify premade assets?
- Build for PC (Steam)
