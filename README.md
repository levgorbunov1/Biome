# Biome
I'm developing an organism simulator for PC (Steam).

Inspired by Spore (https://www.spore.com/).

# Setup
- Install Unity Hub and Unity Editor from https://unity.com/download
- Clone this repository and open it as a project in the Unity Editor
- Unity should automatically generate certain local files/folders, including:
    - Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj
    - Assembly-CSharp.csproj
    - Library/
    - UserSettings/

# Ideas
- Open to collaboration
- Leverage premade assets - Modify premade assets?

# Design descisions
- Dimensions: 3D
- Platform: Built for PC (Steam)
- Genre: Simulator
- Theme: Animal/Organism Simulator
- Polycount: Low (think Spore)
