# Biome
I'm developing an organism simulator for PC (Steam).

Inspired by Spore (https://www.spore.com/).

# Concept
I've always been fascinated by the natural world and ecosystem dynamics, and played a lot of Spore when I was a child, which implements a basic model of natural competition and evolution.
I would like to build a virtual experience similar to Spore but more developed in it's modelling of aspects of the natural world, including concepts such as interspecies competition, reproduction, and evolution.

# Setup
- Install Unity Hub and Unity Editor from https://unity.com/download
- Install Blender for 3D modelling from https://www.blender.org/download/
- Clone this repository and open it as a project in the Unity Editor
- Unity should automatically generate certain local files/folders, including:
    - Assembly-CSharp-Editor.csproj
    - Assembly-CSharp.csproj
    - Library/
    - UserSettings/

# Ideas
- Open to collaboration
- Leverage premade assets - Modify premade assets?

# Design descisions
- Dimensions: 3D
- Platform: Built for PC (Steam)
- Genre: Simulator
- Theme: Animal/Organism Simulator
- Polycount: Low (think Spore)
